Initial purpose to replace leading tab characters with spaces from a Maven plugin. This plugin was created to supplement the formatter-maven-plugin which does not support:
3
* converting leading tabs to spaces (no upper limit to number of spaces per tab. the default is 4 spaces)

* provide a way to add more formatting options in the future
* TODO Add removing trailing whitespace and tabs
